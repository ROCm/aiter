"""Host launch for gfx942/gfx950 TP∈{2,4,8} INT4/INT6 all-reduce.

Public type ``QuickAllReduceInt4``, with two interchangeable schedules selected
by ``algorithm``. Both are two-shot -- reduce-scatter then all-gather -- so
they are named for the topology of each lap instead:

* ``"mesh"`` the default: fanout to all N-1 peers, twice.
* ``"ring"`` 2(N-1) single-destination hops.

Super-tile ST∈{1,8} on the mesh, ST∈{1,8,16,32} on the ring. INT4 nibble or
INT6 bit-plane pair, both with group-16 E4M3 scales. Payload HBM is bf16.

The kernel configuration comes from a tuning ladder of ``TwoShotRung``, keyed
on ``(arch, link, world_size)`` in ``allreduce_policy``.

    Requires a non-NCCL, single-node process group for IPC metadata exchange.

    ``algorithm`` selects the schedule. Both are two-shot -- reduce-scatter
    then all-gather -- so they are named for the topology of each lap:

    * ``"mesh"`` (default): each rank pushes to every one of the ``N-1``
      peers, twice. Two hops. Optimal on a meshed xGMI node.
    * ``"ring"``: ``2(N-1)`` hops, each a single contiguous run into exactly
      one peer's inbox. Same wire volume (``2(N-1)/N`` of the payload), traded
      for per-destination locality. Optimal for large messages on PCIe.

    ``rs_codec`` and ``ag_codec`` are the wire formats of the ring's two laps.
    The reduce-scatter lap requantizes ``N-1`` times and it defaults to ``"int6"``
    at TP8, where INT4 would cost too much accuracy. The all-gather lap forwards
    bytes verbatim and contributes a single quantization, so it defaults to ``"int4"``
    everywhere.

    ``inbox_memory`` selects how the IPC inbox is allocated:

    * ``"auto"`` (default) -- ``uncached`` on hosts with xGMI peer links,
      ``finegrained`` on PCIe-attached hosts, decided from the KFD topology.
      TP2 is ``uncached`` on PCIe too: one remote peer cannot collapse.
    * ``"uncached"`` -- correct everywhere, but peer writes collapse on PCIe.
    * ``"finegrained"`` -- device-coherent, full PCIe rate. Cacheable, so each
      publish writes the payload back from the writer's L2 with a release fence
      before the flag goes out write-through (``sc0 sc1``).

    ``min_bytes`` is the payload below which ``allreduce`` refuses to run,
    defaulting to ``QUANT_MIN_PAYLOAD_BYTES``.

    ``link`` selects the tuning ladder and is detected from the KFD topology
    when not given. ``ladder`` replaces the tuning ladder of the policy, for
    tests that run other configurations, and ``norm_ladder`` does the same for
    the fused add+RMSNorm of the mesh algorithm. Both schedules specialise their
    binary to this rank, so the JIT symbol carries an ``_r<n>_`` field.

    ``rmsnorm_hidden`` lists the row widths ``allreduce_rmsnorm`` will be
    called with.
